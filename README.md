# Advanced-Stellar-Evolution-Simulator
# ROADMAP.md - Advanced Stellar Evolution Simulator

## Project Vision
To create an engaging, visually beautiful, and educational web-based simulator that allows users to explore the lifecycle of stars by manipulating core parameters and observing their evolution and eventual fate. The application should be accessible, performant, and delightful to use.

## Current State (v2 - Refactored)
- Core simulation logic for star types (Protostar to Black Hole/Supernova).
- Interactive sliders for Mass, Gravity Influence, and Hydrogen Percentage.
- 2D Canvas rendering of stars with distinct visual characteristics (color, size, basic effects like coronas, accretion disks, pulsar beams).
- Starry background with twinkling effects.
- Zoom in/out functionality for the canvas.
- Dynamic star designation and informational text display.
- Codebase refactored into `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

## Future Milestones & Features

---

### Phase 1: Core Refinement & Enhanced Realism (Short-Term)
*Goal: Improve the existing simulation's accuracy, visual feedback, and user understanding.*

1.  **[CORE] Advanced Stellar Evolution Logic:**
    *   **Time/Age Parameter:** Introduce an "Evolutionary Age/Stage" slider. This will be the primary driver for a star's progression, internally depleting fuel and triggering phase changes. This makes the hydrogen slider more about *initial* composition.
    *   **Metallicity Parameter:** Add a slider for "Metallicity (Z)". This affects star color, lifespan, and potentially end-states.
    *   **Fuel Consumption Model:** Implement a more nuanced (but still simplified) model for hydrogen (and potentially helium) depletion based on mass and luminosity.
    *   **More Granular Star Types:** Differentiate stellar types more clearly (e.g., spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M for main sequence; specific types of giants like Asymptotic Giant Branch stars).
    *   **Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (Optional):** Consider a simple visual plot of the current star on an H-R diagram.

2.  **[VISUALS] Enhanced Star Rendering:**
    *   **Surface Detail:** Add subtle, procedural 2D textures or animated effects to star surfaces (e.g., convection cells for sun-like stars, more dynamic flares for active stars).
    *   **Improved Nebulae:** More volumetric and dynamic planetary nebulae and supernova remnants (e.g., layered particle effects, shockwave visuals).
    *   **Atmospheric Perspective:** Subtle "haze" or color shifting for very distant background stars.

3.  **[UI/UX] Improved Information Display:**
    *   **Derived Parameters:** Show calculated parameters like estimated Temperature (K), Luminosity (L☉), Radius (R☉), and Lifespan.
    *   **Event Log:** A concise log that notes significant evolutionary events as they happen (e.g., "Main Sequence Ignition," "Helium Flash," "Core Collapse").
    *   **Contextual Help/Tooltips:** Provide brief explanations for scientific terms or slider effects on hover.

### Phase 2: Expanding the Cosmos (Medium-Term)
*Goal: Add more depth to the simulation environment and introduce new observable phenomena.*

1.  **[SIMULATION] Multi-Star Systems & Planets (Ambitious):**
    *   **Binary Systems:** Allow for the creation of simple binary star systems and observe their interactions (mass transfer, unique evolutionary paths). This is a significant complexity increase.
    *   **Exoplanet Formation (Conceptual):** Visually hint at protoplanetary disks around young stars and perhaps allow toggling a "habitable zone" overlay. (Full planet simulation is likely out of scope for a single-file like approach without major abstraction).

2.  **[VISUALS] Dynamic Background Enhancements:**
    *   **Procedural Galactic Dust/Gas:** More pronounced and dynamic background nebulae or dust lanes for a richer cosmic backdrop.
    *   **Lens Flares/Bloom:** Subtle, tasteful lens flare effects when viewing very bright stars, or bloom post-processing for intense glows.

3.  **[INTERACTIVITY] Observable Phenomena:**
    *   **Variable Stars:** Model simple pulsations for certain star types (e.g., Cepheids, Mira variables) with corresponding light curve hints.
    *   **Stellar Winds & Mass Ejection:** More prominent visual representation of stellar winds and episodic mass loss for relevant star types (e.g., Wolf-Rayet stars, Red Supergiants).

4.  **[UI/UX] Saving & Sharing (Conceptual for single HTML, local storage possible):**
    *   **Parameter Snapshots:** Allow users to "save" interesting star configurations (perhaps to browser local storage as a string of parameters).
    *   **Shareable Links:** Generate a URL with parameters encoded, so users can share specific simulations (e.g., `index.html#mass=10&hydro=50...`).

### Phase 3: Polish & "Wow" Factor (Long-Term)
*Goal: Elevate the application to a highly polished, almost artistic experience.*

1.  **[AUDIO] Immersive Soundscape (Visual Cues only, due to single file constraint):**
    *   **Subtle Visual Feedback for "Sound":** Continue to refine visual cues that *imply* sound events (e.g., a shimmer for a "ping" from a pulsar, a deep ripple for a "rumble" of a supernova). *No actual audio files to maintain single HTML constraint.*

2.  **[VISUALS] Advanced Rendering Techniques (within Canvas 2D limitations):**
    *   **Custom Shaders (Conceptual for Canvas):** Explore if any simplified shader-like effects can be emulated through clever compositing or pixel manipulation for things like gravitational lensing (very difficult in pure 2D canvas).
    *   **Particle System Overhaul:** A more robust and versatile particle engine for more diverse and beautiful effects.

3.  **[EDUCATIONAL] Integrated Learning:**
    *   **Mini-Encyclopedia:** Brief, accessible explanations of key astronomical concepts linked from the info panel.
    *   **"Guided Tour" Scenarios:** Pre-set parameter configurations that guide the user through notable stellar evolution paths (e.g., "Life of a Sun-like Star," "Fate of a Massive Star").

4.  **[OPTIMIZATION] Performance Audit:**
    *   Thorough profiling and optimization, especially for particle systems and complex rendering, ensuring smooth operation even on less powerful devices.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Ongoing)
*   **Performance:** Continuously monitor and optimize, especially drawing and simulation logic.
*   **Code Quality:** Maintain clear, commented, and (as much as possible for a large single JS file) modular code. If this ever breaks out of single-file, adopt proper module patterns.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Ensure controls are intuitive and the information presented is clear and understandable.
*   **Scientific Accuracy (Simplified):** While a simulation, strive for conceptual accuracy in the evolutionary paths and phenomena depicted. Clearly note simplifications.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Consider basic accessibility for controls (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes where appropriate), though full accessibility for a canvas-heavy app is challenging.

## Technology Stack (Current)
*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6+) with HTML5 Canvas API

## Notes
*   This roadmap is a living document and can be adjusted based on development progress, user feedback, and new ideas.
*   Features marked "Ambitious" or "Conceptual" require careful feasibility assessment within the single-file constraint or may necessitate breaking that constraint if pursued fully.
